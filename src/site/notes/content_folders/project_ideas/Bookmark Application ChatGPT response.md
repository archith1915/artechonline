# Updated Description

This is a full-stack web application built using React.js and Express.js, designed to help users save, manage, and categorize bookmarks intelligently using Google Sheets as the database. Each user can connect their personal sheet and a group/shared sheet via the admin panel. Bookmarks can include a title, description, category, and tags. Users can assign categories such as AI, Technology, Defence, and also add custom tags like #foundOnInstagram. Tags can either be manually entered or generated automatically using AI. A checkbox in the form allows the user to specify whether a link should be added to the shared database. The group sheet uses `Owner` and `Public` fields to manage access and visibility. Duplicate links are automatically discarded if they already exist in the group sheet, even if added by a different user.

Each user can view their bookmarks grouped by category or tag, search using keywords, and filter using tag or category buttons. Only the creator of a bookmark can edit or delete it in the shared database. Users can configure their personal and group sheet URLs in the admin panel. Bookmark links are displayed with their title, description, category, tags, and a copy/share button, alongside a link preview generated using OpenGraph metadata (title and image).

An AI-powered assistant allows users to search their bookmarks with natural language queries such as ‚Äúshow me all Instagram links added by others last week‚Äù or ‚Äúdisplay AI tools saved in 2023‚Äù. This assistant parses the query and filters results accordingly. The app includes full CRUD functionality: users can create, update, and delete bookmarks with validations in place. All changes made across the system are logged in an internal activity log with timestamps for future reference.

The app includes user authentication with secure email-password login (no Google login). Passwords are strictly hashed using a one-way salted hashing function (bcryptjs), and JWT is used for session management. Users can update their settings via a settings panel, including preferences like default category or tag, and whether they want weekly email digests.

The app sends weekly email summaries using the Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) transactional API. These emails highlight new bookmarks added, popular tags, and category activity. The UI is responsive and mobile-friendly, and the app includes PWA support for installability and offline experience. Abuse protection is handled using rate limiting on API routes to prevent spam or misuse. A browser extension for saving bookmarks directly from any page is planned for future development. The application does not use folder-based organization, by design.


# Vibe coding prompt

Build a **modern, interactive, and visually polished bookmark manager web application** using **React.js** for the frontend and **Express.js** for the backend. The design should follow a _‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù_ aesthetic‚Äîsmooth, minimalist, animated, responsive, and dark-mode first.
