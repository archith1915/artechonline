# What are tags in HTML?

- Tags are the demarcations used in HTML. Any content to be displayed on the webpage is enclosed in tags to have better control over their structure and style. 
- Tags in HTML are opened and closed. An opening tag is just the name of the tag enclosed in angle brackets (ex: \<span\>). The closing tag is denoted by a '/' just after the left angle bracket (ex : \</span>).
- HTML 5 introduced semantic tags. The names of the tags define their purpose making them easier to understand and use.

> Note : Semantic - 1. relating to meaning in language or logic.

- There are various tags in HTML each defined for a specific purpose. Some of the frequently used tags are explained below.
