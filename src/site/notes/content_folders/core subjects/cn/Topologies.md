Topology refers to the structure or layout of a computer network. It defines how nodes and cables are connected on a network.
This arrangement determines how data flows, how easily networks can expand or troubleshoot issues, and overall network performance. 

# Categories of Topology

- **Physical Topology**: The actual layout of cables and devices in the network.
- **Logical Topology**: The path that data takes across the network, which can be different from the physical layout

## Bus topology:
### Description

All devices are connected to a single central cable (bus). Each device communicates over this shared medium.

### Advantages

- Easy and inexpensive to implement for small networks.
- Requires less cable than other topologies

### Disadvantages

- A fault in the bus will bring down the entire network.
- Poor scalability; efficiency drops with more devices.
- High data collision risk, reducing performance under heavy load.
- Difficult to troubleshoot
---

## Star topology:

### Description

Every device connects to a central hub or switch; all communication passes through this point.

### Advantages

- Easy to install, manage, and troubleshoot.
- Failure of one cable/device does not affect others.
- Centralized management and scaling possible.

### Disadvantages

- Network fails if the central hub breaks down.
- Requires more cable than bus topology

---

## Ring Topology

### Description

Each device is connected to two others, forming a closed loop.

### Advantages

- Predictable data flow, often with reduced collision risk.
- Easy to identify faults.
- Can handle moderate traffic loads efficiently.

### Disadvantages

- Failure of a single node or cable can disrupt the whole network.
- Network performance degrades when adding/removing nodes.
- Data packets have to travel through multiple nodes, potentially slowing transmission.

---

## Mesh topology

### Description

Every device is connected to every other device. Used where high availability is essential.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Basic Understanding

 1. **What is a network topology?**

	A network topology is the arrangement of different network devices and how they are interconnected, determining the layout and data flow of a network. It influences network performance, scalability, maintenance, and fault tolerance.

2. **How many types of network topologies are there, and what are they called?**

	There are several types of network topologies, including:
	
	- Bus
	- Star
	- Ring
	- Mesh
	- Tree
	- Hybrid

3. **What is the difference between physical and logical topology?**

	- **Physical topology** describes the actual physical layout of devices, cables, and hardware.
	- **Logical topology** refers to the way data moves through the network, which might differ from its physical arrangement.

## Topology-Specific Questions

1. **What is a Bus Topology? What are its main advantages and disadvantages?**

	In bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable.  
	**Advantages:**
	
	- Inexpensive for small networks
	- Uses the least cabling
	
	**Disadvantages:**
	
	- If the main cable fails, the whole network goes down
	- Difficult to troubleshoot
	- Limited scalability and high collision risk

2. **Explain Star Topology. How does it handle network failures?**

	In star topology, every device connects to a central hub or switch.  
	**Failure Handling:** If a device or its cable fails, only that device is affected. However, if the central hub fails, the entire network is disrupted.

3. **What are the characteristics and pros/cons of Ring Topology?**

	- Devices connect in a closed loop.
	- Data flows in one direction (or both, in dual rings).  
	    **Pros:** Predictable data flow, easy fault identification  
	    **Cons:** One failure can disrupt the whole network, and adding/removing devices is disruptive

4. **Describe Mesh Topology. What is the difference between full and partial mesh?**

	In mesh topology, every device connects directly to every other device.
	
	- **Full mesh:** All devices are interconnected
	- **Partial mesh:** Only select devices are interconnected  
	    **Advantage:** High fault tolerance  
	    **Disadvantage:** Complex and costly to implement

5. **Explain Tree Topology. In which situations is it preferred?**

	Tree topology is hierarchical, combining star and bus topologies.  
	**Preferred in:** Large organizations with departments, as it allows for easy expansion and fault isolation at branch levels.

6. **What is a Hybrid Topology? What benefits does it provide over other topologies?**

	Hybrid topology is a combination of two or more topologies (e.g., star-bus).  
	**Benefits:** Inherits advantages of the combined topologies and can be tailored to specific requirements, improving flexibility and scalability.

## Practical Application & Comparison

1. **In which scenarios would you recommend each topology (bus, star, ring, mesh, tree, hybrid)?**

	- **Bus:** Small, cost-sensitive LANs
	- **Star:** Office networks, easy management and troubleshooting
	- **Ring:** Environments requiring ordered and reliable data transfer
	- **Mesh:** Critical networks needing high availability (e.g., data centers)
	- **Tree:** Large, structured organizations
	- **Hybrid:** Large enterprises needing customized solutions

2. **How do you decide the best topology for a specific environment?**

	Consider factors such as network size, required scalability, fault tolerance, budget, and maintenance. The optimal topology balances these needs for the particular scenario.

3. **Compare the scalability and fault tolerance among star, bus, and mesh topologies.**

	- **Star:** Good scalability, moderate fault tolerance (central hub is critical point)
	- **Bus:** Poor scalability and fault tolerance (main cable failure affects all)
	- **Mesh:** Excellent fault tolerance and scalability but at a high cost

4. **How does topology affect network performance and cost?**

	Star and mesh topologies offer better performance and fault tolerance but are costlier. Bus is inexpensive but struggles with performance and reliability as size grows.

5. **What kind of topology is used to minimize network traffic and why?**

	Mesh topology minimizes traffic by providing direct communication paths; data doesn't traverse unnecessary devices, reducing congestion.

## Design & Maintenance

1. **How many ports and cables are required for a star topology with ‘n’ devices?**
	
	- **Ports:** n ports on the central hub/switch (one per device)
	- **Cables:** n cables (each device connects to the hub)

2. **How does star topology isolate faults compared to bus and ring topologies?**

	In a star, a device or cable failure affects only that device, making it easy to isolate and fix. In bus or ring, a single point of failure can bring down the entire network, making fault isolation harder.

3. **How does adding or removing nodes affect different topologies?**
	
	- **Star:** Easy to add/remove devices without disturbing others
	- **Bus/Ring:** Adding/removing can disrupt the network and requires downtime

4. **What are common challenges in expanding or troubleshooting a bus or ring topology network?**

	- **Bus**: Troubleshooting cable faults can be difficult; expansion increases chances of collisions
	- **Ring**: Removing or adding nodes requires breaking the ring, causing downtime

## Advanced & Scenario-Based Questions

1. **How would you upgrade a bus topology to improve fault tolerance?**

	Convert it to a star or mesh topology by adding a central hub or multiple interconnections, thus eliminating the single point of failure.

2. **What impact does hybrid topology have on network design and complexity?**

	Hybrid topologies allow customization for specific needs but greatly increase design and maintenance complexity.

3. **Which topology would you use in a large enterprise network for high availability and why?**

	Mesh or hybrid topologies are preferred due to their high resilience, redundancy, and ability to support mission-critical operations without single points of failure.

4. **How does data transmission differ in ring versus mesh topology?**

	- **Ring:** Data travels through nodes sequentially, which can introduce latency.
	- **Mesh:** Data takes the shortest, most efficient path between devices, improving speed and reliability.
