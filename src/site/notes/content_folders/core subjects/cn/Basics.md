# Core Concepts and Terminologies

1. **Computer network:** A computer network is a set of autonomous computers connected to each other through a medium like the internet for communication and resource sharing.
2. **Host**: Any device that is connected to the network is called a host.
3. **Client**: A device that makes a request during a communication is called a client.
4. **Server**: A device that responds to a request from a client during a communication is called a server.
5. **[[IP Addresses\|IP address]]**: A unique identifier for a device on a network.
6. **Mac address**: A physical address permanently assigned to a network interface card (NIC).
7. **Port Number**: A logical endpoint for communication that differentiates multiple services on the same device.
8. **[[Internet Protocols\|Protocol]]**: A set of rules that define how data is transmitted and interpreted.
9. **Bandwidth**: The maximum amount of data transferrable per second (capacity).
10. **Throughput**: The amount of data successfully transferred per second.
11. **Latency**: The delay between sending a request and receiving a response.
12. **Packet/Segment/Datagram/Frame**: Units of data at different layers (Packet: Network layer, Frame: Data link layer, Segment: Transport layer, Datagram: Connectionless transmission).
13. **Unicast**: One-to-one transmission of data.
14. **Multicast:** One-to-many transmission of data.
15. **Broadcast:** One-to-All transmission of data.
16. **Synchronous**: Communication *with* waiting for responses in a sequence.
17. **Asynchronous**: Communication *without* waiting for responses in a sequence.


# Network structures

1. **Topology:** The physical or logical arrangement of network devices (bus, hub, modem, etc).
2. **LAN (Local area network):** A small-scale network within a limited area such as an office or home.
3. **WAN (Wide area network):** A large-scale network that connects across cities or countries.
4. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network covering a city or large campus.
5. **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A very small network, typically involving Bluetooth or hotspots.
6. **Client-Server Model**: A centralized server provides resources to clients.
7. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P)**: Devices share resources directly without a central server.
8. **Intranet**: A private internal network.
9. **Internet**: The global network of interconnected networks.
10. **Extranet**: A controlled extension of an intranet that allows access to external partners.


# Communication models

1. **OSI Model**: A conceptual seven-layer model for network communication.
2. **TCP/IP Model**: A practical four-layer model (Link, Internet, Transport, Application).
3. **Encapsulation/Decapsulation**: The process of wrapping and unwrapping data with headers and trailers at each layer.
4. **Socket**: An endpoint of a two-way communication link, defined by IP address and port number.
5. **Networking APIs**: Interfaces for applications to use networking capabilities (for example, HTTP libraries).

# Networking devices

1. **Router**: Directs packets between different networks.
2. **Switch**: Connects devices within a LAN and forwards frames intelligently.
3. **Hub**: A basic device that broadcasts incoming signals to all connected devices.
4. **Modem**: Converts digital data into signals for transmission over telephone or cable lines.
5. **Firewall**: Filters network traffic based on security rules.
6. **Access Point (AP)**: Provides wireless connectivity to a wired network.

# Protocols

1. **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, connection-oriented communication.
2. **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Fast, connectionless, and less reliable communication.
3. **HTTP / HTTPS**: Protocols for web communication; HTTPS includes encryption.
4. **FTP / SFTP**: File transfer protocols; SFTP adds security.
5. **SMTP / IMAP / POP3**: Email protocols for sending and receiving messages.
6. **DNS (Domain Name System)**: Converts domain names to IP addresses.
7. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatically assigns IP addresses.
8. **SSH (Secure Shell)**: Secure remote login and command execution.
